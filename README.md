# SaveMeASpot
hackUMBC 2024 Submission

SaveMeASpot is an application designed to help those on University campus be able to quickly find open parking spots. UMBC parking is far from ideal due to the high amount of people needing to park at any given time on campus, the low amount of parking that is available for both commuters and students compared to the amount of people that need to park, and the fact that many lots for both commuters and students are spread out around the edge of campus. This makes finding parking spots in a campus bustling with drivers even harder since you don't know whether the lots you're allowed to park in have availble spots in the first place. SaveMeASpot shows UMBC's parking lots and updates in real time to show any available spots that can be parked in.
